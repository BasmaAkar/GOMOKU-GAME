Gomoku Game build with java using  Algorithm "Alphabeta"
### What's Gomoku? :
Gomoku, also called Five in a Row, is an abstract strategy board game. It is traditionally played with Go pieces (black and white stones) on a Go board. It is played using a 15×15 board[1][2] while in the past a 19×19 board was standard.[3][4] Because pieces are typically not moved or removed from the board, gomoku may also be played as a paper-and-pencil game. The game is known in several countries under different names.
